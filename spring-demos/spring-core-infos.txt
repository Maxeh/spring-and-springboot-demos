Summary Spring core:

There are a couple of different ways to do the IoC:
- use only XML configuration (this is normally only found in legacy projects)
- use XML (with component scan) and java annotations
- use a java config file (with component scan) and java annotations
- use a java config file with beans and java annotations

=> you can do the component scan approach or explicitly define the beans yourself in the java config file

More infos:
- the annotations @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy are not part of spring but part of the 
javax.annotation package. Spring recognizes the annotations and performs the actions.
